Opening:

“Today, I’m starting a new chapter in my life. The truth is, I’ve been through a lot—there were times when I felt totally lost and like nothing would ever go right. I’ve faced a lot of struggles, made a ton of mistakes, and honestly, at some points, I didn’t even know if I wanted to keep going. It felt like life was just beating me down.

But here’s the thing: I’m not defined by my struggles. I’m not defined by my past mistakes. I’m choosing today to rewrite my story.”


Main Body:

“I’ve made my fair share of wrong decisions. I’ve failed more times than I can count. But each failure taught me something valuable, and over time, I realized that none of that is the end of the road. It’s just part of the journey.

Now, I’m starting fresh. I’m diving back into coding, from square one. I know it won’t be easy, and I know I’ll hit roadblocks along the way. But I’m ready for the challenge. I’m not just doing this for a career—I’m doing this because it’s my way of proving to myself what I’m truly capable of.

It’s not about trying to prove the people who doubted me wrong—it’s about showing myself what I can do when I really push myself.”


Closing:

“I’m not pretending like everything’s going to be easy or that success is guaranteed. But I know this: I won’t quit. This is my chance to change things, to prove that I have what it takes. I’m ready to put in the work, and I’m ready to see where this journey takes me.

One year from now, I’m going to look back and know that I gave it everything I had. I’ll know that I fought for my future and that I didn’t let my past stop me. I’m rewriting my story, starting today.”
