#######  CALL  #####################3

(.this)call passes current execution context to another function
to hold reference (variable)inside of call stack we use call

cause work from top element
and incase if 2nd stack element wanted to use reference of 1st element of stack 
and if its not present in stack, that would be problem cause, once first element 
of stack execute then it remove its execution context and remove all the variables
