**inside of the class dont need to use function keyword

################  Why don't you need the function keyword?  ##################
* 1. In ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), the class syntax was introduced to make JavaScript's object-oriented programming more intuitive and similar to other languages like Java or C++.
* 2. Inside a class, methods are defined directly without the function keyword to keep the syntax clean and concise.
* 3. The function keyword is only used for standalone functions or functions defined outside of a class.

definition : classes are an es6 feature that provides a more structured and cleaner way 
to work with objects compared to traditional constructor function that we're normally used to.

another definition : Classes in JavaScript are blueprints for creating objects, encapsulating data (properties) and 
		     behavior (methods) into a single unit, using the class keyword introduced in ES6.
