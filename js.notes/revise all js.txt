shallow and deep copy
whenever we perform copy operation in array it always create shall copy



Shallow Copy Methods:
A shallow copy creates a new object or array where only the first level of data is copied.
If the original object or array contains nested objects or arrays,
 the shallow copy will still reference those nested structures (i.e., they are not copied but shared)

use in :
Array methods like slice() or concat() for arrays.
*******************************************************************
Deep Copy Methods:

 A deep copy creates a completely independent copy of the object or array,
including all nested objects or arrays. Modifications to the copied object or array will not affect the original

use in :
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) (simple but doesnâ€™t work with functions, undefined, or circular references).
Libraries like lodash (_.cloneDeep) for more robust deep copying.

conclussion : 
1.original array affects in shallow copy
2.original array dont affect in deep copy
