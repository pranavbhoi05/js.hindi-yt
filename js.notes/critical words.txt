*Encapsulation : 
Encapsulation is about bundling data and behavior into a single unit (e.g., a class or object).
It involves hiding the internal state of an object and providing controlled access through methods.
The goal is to protect data integrity, reduce complexity, and improve maintainability.
Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in OOP and is essential for writing clean, secure, and reusable code.
